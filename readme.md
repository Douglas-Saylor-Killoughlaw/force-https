### Disclaimer

We developed this code to provide better features for our managed hosting clients, and that remains our primary goal here. Although we are 100% open to fielding requests from the WordPress community, we kindly ask that you keep these conditions in mind, and refrain from slandering, threatening, or harassing our team members in order to get a feature added, or to otherwise get "free" support. The only place you should be contacting us is in our free [**Facebook group**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/littlebizzy/) which has been setup for this purpose, or via GitHub if you are an experienced developer. Thanks ahead of time!
